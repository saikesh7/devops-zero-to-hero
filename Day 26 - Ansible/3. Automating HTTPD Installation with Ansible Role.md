## ✅ **Installation of httpd using Ansible Role**

**httpd** is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It is designed to be run as a standalone daemon process to serve web content over HTTP.

Here’s a basic example of using a **playbook** to install and configure `httpd` **without roles** (just to match your request):

---

### 🔧 **Simple Playbook (Without Roles)**

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Apache HTTPD
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Copy index.html file
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: Start and enable httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

> 📝 Place your `index.html` file in the same directory as this playbook.

### 📁 Want It as a Role? (Bonus)

If you want to convert this into a **reusable Ansible role**, here’s the **minimal structure**:

```
roles/
└── httpd/
    ├── tasks/
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files/
    │   └── index.html
```

**roles/httpd/tasks/main.yml**

```yaml
---
- name: Install httpd
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: present

- name: Copy index.html
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

- name: Start and enable httpd
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```

**Playbook to call the role:**

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  roles:
    - httpd
```
