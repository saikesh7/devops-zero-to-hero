## üîê What is Ansible Vault?

**Ansible Vault** is a feature that allows you to **encrypt sensitive data** such as passwords, API keys, configuration files, and variables within Ansible projects. This ensures that confidential information is **not exposed** in plain text, even to system administrators, unless they provide the correct vault password.

> üîí If a playbook or variable file is encrypted with Ansible Vault, it **cannot be read or executed** without the correct password.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working with Ansible Vault

### ‚úÖ Encrypt a New File

```bash
ansible-vault create filename.yml
```

* Prompts for a vault password and opens the file in the default editor.

### ‚úÖ Encrypt an Existing File

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt filename.yml
```

### üîì Decrypt a Vault File

```bash
ansible-vault decrypt filename.yml
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Edit an Encrypted File

```bash
ansible-vault edit filename.yml
```

* Opens the file in edit mode after verifying the vault password.

### üëÅÔ∏è View Encrypted File Contents

```bash
ansible-vault view filename.yml
```

### üîÅ Change Vault Password (Rekey)

```bash
ansible-vault rekey filename.yml
```

* Prompts for the old and new passwords.

## üöÄ Running Encrypted Playbooks

If a playbook or variable file is encrypted, running it **without the vault password** will fail. Use one of the following:

### üîê Prompt for Password

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### üìÇ Use a Password File

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file=vault_pass.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `vault_pass.txt` is properly secured and not committed to version control (e.g., add it to `.gitignore`).
