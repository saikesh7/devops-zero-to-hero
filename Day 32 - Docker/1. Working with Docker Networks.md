### What is Docker network

- A **Docker network** is a virtual network that allows Docker containers to communicate with each other and with external systems.
- It provides isolation, security, and connectivity for containers running on the same host or across multiple hosts.


#### **Types of Docker Networks**:

| Network Type      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bridge**        | Default network for containers on a single host. Containers get a private IP and can talk to each other.    |
| **host**          | Removes the network isolation; container shares the host's network stack. No separate IP for the container. |
| **none**          | No network access. Useful for security/isolation.                                                           |
| **overlay**       | Enables communication across multiple Docker hosts (used with Docker Swarm or manual configuration).        |
| **custom bridge** | A user-defined bridge that allows container name-based DNS resolution and better control.                   |


### 🧠 Why Use Docker Networks?

* **Service Discovery**: Containers can communicate using container names in a custom network.
* **Isolation**: Prevent containers from talking to each other unless explicitly allowed.
* **Security**: Custom networks can be secured using firewalls or by limiting access.
* **Scalability**: Overlay networks help scale across multiple Docker hosts.

### 🧑‍💻 Working with Docker Network

#### 📋 List all Docker networks:

```bash
docker network ls
```

#### 🛠️ Create a new network:

```bash
docker network create <network_name>
```

#### 🔍 Inspect a specific network:

```bash
docker network inspect <network_name>
```

#### 🔗 Connect a container to a network:

```bash
docker network connect <network_name> <container_name_or_id>
```

#### 🔌 Disconnect a container from a network:

```bash
docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name_or_id>
```

#### 🗑️ Remove a network:

```bash
docker network rm <network_name>
```

#### 🧹 Remove all **unused** networks:

```bash
docker network prune
```
