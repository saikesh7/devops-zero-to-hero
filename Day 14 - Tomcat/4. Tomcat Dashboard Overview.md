## 🖥️ Tomcat Dashboard Overview

The **Tomcat Dashboard** (Manager App) is a **web-based interface** that allows administrators to:

- Deploy and undeploy applications
- Start and stop web apps
- Reload applications without restarting the server
- View application status and server information

## 🧩 Sections of the Tomcat Dashboard

### 1. **Server Information**
- Tomcat version
- JVM version
- Operating system details
- Available memory and uptime

### 2. **Applications List**
This is the main section and shows a table of all deployed web applications:

| **Column**       | **Description**                                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Path**         | URL path of the deployed app (e.g., `/myapp`)              |
| **Display Name** | Friendly name of the app                                   |
| **Running**      | Whether the app is currently running or stopped             |
| **Sessions**     | Active user sessions count                                  |
| **Commands**     | Start, Stop, Reload, Undeploy, Expire Sessions              |

You can directly perform actions from here like:
- 🔄 **Reload** the app without restarting Tomcat
- 🛑 **Stop** or 🚀 **Start** an application
- 🗑️ **Undeploy** an application
- 💣 **Expire sessions** for testing or clearing old users

### 3. **Deploy Section**
At the bottom of the page, you’ll find:
- **Upload WAR file** – to deploy new applications
- **Deploy Directory or WAR by URL** – if the app is hosted on a different server
- **Context Path and XML configuration** – for manual, advanced deployments

### 4. **Diagnostics and Server Status**
If you have the `manager-status` role, you’ll get access to:
- Thread info
- Memory usage
- Connector stats (HTTP, AJP)
- Request processing times


## 🔒 Required Roles

To access this dashboard, the user must have the `manager-gui` role.

```xml
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
```

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- Only expose the dashboard on **localhost** or behind a VPN
- Use **strong passwords** and role separation
- Monitor and audit access for security
- Disable the Manager App in production if not needed
