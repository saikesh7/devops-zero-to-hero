## **Deploying a WAR File in Tomcat**

**Example:** We are going to deploy the Jenkins WAR file on Tomcat.

---

### **Step 1: Download the Jenkins WAR File**

Download the Jenkins WAR from the official Jenkins website:

ðŸ”— Website: [https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war/](https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war/)

Run the following command to download a specific version (e.g., 2.462.3):
```bash
wget https://updates.jenkins.io/download/war/2.462.3/jenkins.war
```

---

### **Step 2: Copy the WAR File to Tomcatâ€™s `webapps` Directory**

Move the downloaded `jenkins.war` file to the Tomcat `webapps` folder:
```bash
mv jenkins.war /opt/tomcat-1/webapps/
```

---

### **Step 3: Restart Tomcat**

Restart the Tomcat service to trigger deployment:
```bash
systemctl restart tomcat
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Jenkins is Running**

Open a web browser and go to:
```
http://52.65.38.54:8080/jenkins
```

If everything went well, Jenkins should load in your browser.

---

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the WAR file on Tomcat.**
