## 🔧 Changing the Port Number in Tomcat (Linux)

By default, Tomcat runs on port **8080**. To change it:

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Locate `server.xml`**

Navigate to the `conf` directory inside your Tomcat installation:
```bash
cd /opt/tomcat-1/conf/
```

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Edit `server.xml`**

Open `server.xml` using a text editor:
```bash
sudo vi server.xml
```

Look for the following line (usually near the top):
```xml
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
```

Change `8080` to your desired port, for example `9090`:
```xml
<Connector port="9090" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
```

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Save and Exit**

- In `vi`, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter` to save and exit.

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Restart Tomcat**

Restart the Tomcat service to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Verify**

Open your browser and access Tomcat using the new port:
```
http://<your-server-ip>:9090/
```

---

### 📝 Notes:
- Make sure the new port (e.g., `9090`) is allowed in your firewall or security group.
- If SELinux is enabled, you may need to allow the new port.
