## What is ansible module 

An **Ansible module** is a reusable, standalone unit of code used by Ansible to perform specific tasks on managed nodes (remote systems). Think of a module as a **tool** that Ansible uses to execute an action, such as installing a package, copying a file, restarting a service, or managing users.

### ðŸ”§ Key Characteristics of Ansible Modules:

* **Task-oriented**: Each module is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., manage files, services, packages).
* **Idempotent**: Running a module multiple times doesn't change the result if the system is already in the desired state.
* **Language-neutral**: Most Ansible modules are written in Python, but you can write them in any language as long as they follow Ansible's input/output (JSON) format.
* **Used in Playbooks or ad-hoc commands**: You use modules in YAML-based playbooks or directly via the `ansible` command line.

### ðŸ§± Example: Using a Module in a Playbook

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx on web servers
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

* Here, `yum` is the module used to **install a package** on a RedHat-based system.

### 1. **`yum` Module**

* The `yum` module is used to manage packages on RedHat-based systems (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora).
* It allows you to install, remove, or update software packages.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Install httpd package
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
```

**Parameters:**

* `name`: The package name.
* `state`: Defines whether the package should be installed (`present`), removed (`absent`), or updated (`latest`).

### 2. **`copy` Module**

* The `copy` module is used to copy files or directories from the local machine to a remote machine.
* It also allows setting file permissions, owner, and group for the copied files.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Copy file to remote server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Copy the custom config file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/file.conf
        dest: /path/to/remote/file.conf
        mode: '0644'
```

**Parameters:**

* `src`: Path to the source file on the local machine.
* `dest`: Path where the file will be copied on the remote machine.
* `mode`: Permissions to set on the file.

### 3. **`service` Module**

* The `service` module is used to manage services (start, stop, restart) on remote hosts.
* It can be used to ensure that a specific service is running, stopped, or restarted.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Ensure httpd is running
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Start the Apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

**Parameters:**

* `name`: The name of the service.
* `state`: Desired state of the service (`started`, `stopped`, `restarted`, `reloaded`).

### 4. **`get_url` Module**

* The `get_url` module is used to download files from the internet, similar to the `wget` command.
* It can be used to fetch files and put them on the remote server.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Download a file from a URL
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Download a zip file
      get_url:
        url: http://example.com/file.zip
        dest: /tmp/file.zip
```

**Parameters:**

* `url`: The URL to fetch the file from.
* `dest`: Destination path on the remote server where the file will be saved.

### 5. **`user` Module**

* The `user` module is used to manage users on the remote machine.
* It allows you to create, modify, or remove user accounts.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Create a new user
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add a user
      user:
        name: john_doe
        state: present
        groups: wheel
        shell: /bin/bash
```

**Parameters:**

* `name`: The username.
* `state`: Desired state (`present` to create, `absent` to remove).
* `groups`: Groups the user should belong to.
* `shell`: The shell assigned to the user.

### 6. **`group` Module**

* The `group` module is used to manage groups on the remote machine.
* It allows you to create, modify, or remove groups.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
- name: Create a group
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add a new group
      group:
        name: admin_group
        state: present
```

**Parameters:**

* `name`: The group name.
* `state`: Desired state (`present` to create, `absent` to remove).

### Key Points:

* **Idempotency**: Ansible modules are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without changing the result after the first run. This ensures that the system is always in the desired state.
* **Remote Execution**: All these modules are executed on the remote hosts, ensuring consistency in the automation process.

### ðŸ§° Custom Modules

You can also write your own modules if the built-in ones don't meet your needs. Custom modules follow the same structure and interface as official ones.
