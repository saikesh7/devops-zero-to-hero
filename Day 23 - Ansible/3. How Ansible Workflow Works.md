### Key Components in the Diagram:

1. **Ansible Management Node**:

   * This is the central system where Ansible is installed.
   * It acts as the control node and does not require any agent installation on the target systems.
   * All automation tasks are initiated from here.

2. **Playbook**:

   * A YAML file that contains a set of automation tasks written in human-readable syntax.
   * Defines "what to do" on the managed nodes (e.g., install a package, start a service).

3. **Inventory**:

   * A file that lists the target hosts (also called managed nodes) and groups them.
   * Example from the image:

     ```
     [Group A]
     Host1
     [Group B]
     Host2
     HostN
     ```

4. **SSH Connections**:

   * Ansible uses **SSH** (Secure Shell) to connect to the managed nodes (hosts).
   * No agent is required on the target hosts; just SSH access and Python should be installed.

5. **Managed Nodes**:

   * These are the actual systems (e.g., servers) where tasks will be executed.
   * Grouped logically in the inventory (e.g., Group A, Group B, Group N).

### Workflow Explanation:

* The **Ansible Management Node** reads the **inventory** to determine which hosts to manage.
* It then executes the tasks defined in the **playbook** on those hosts.
* Communication with all hosts (e.g., Host 1, Host 2, Host N) happens over **SSH**.
