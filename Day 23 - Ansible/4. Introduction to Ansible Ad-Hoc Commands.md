## 🛠️ **What is an Ansible Ad-Hoc Command?**

An **Ansible ad-hoc command** is a **one-liner command** used to perform a **quick, single task** on one or more remote hosts — without the need to write a full playbook.

> Think of it as a quick shell command for remote machines — powered by Ansible.


## ✅ **When to Use Ad-Hoc Commands**

Use ad-hoc commands when you need to:

* Reboot a server
* Install or remove a package
* Copy or manage files
* Start, stop, or restart a service
* Run a shell command remotely

## 🧩 **Ways to Use Ad-Hoc Commands**

There are **three primary ways** to structure ad-hoc commands:

1. **Module with arguments**
   Example: `ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"`

2. **Module only (default behavior)**
   Example: `ansible all -m ping`

3. **Arguments only (with default module)**
   Not typically used, as both module and arguments are usually specified.
