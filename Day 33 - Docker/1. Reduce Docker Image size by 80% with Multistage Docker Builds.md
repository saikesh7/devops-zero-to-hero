## Reduce Docker Image size by 80% with Multistage Docker Builds

Reducing Docker image size by **up to 80%** is very achievable using **Multistage Docker Builds** — a powerful technique to separate the build environment from the final runtime image.

### 🛠️ What is a Multistage Docker Build?

A **multistage build** uses **multiple `FROM` statements** in a single Dockerfile. The first stage builds the application (with compilers, dev tools, etc.), and later stages copy only the needed artifacts into a minimal final image — leaving behind all the bulky build-time dependencies.

### 📉 Why It Greatly Reduces Image Size

Without multistage builds:

* Your image includes **compilers**, **package managers**, and **build artifacts**.
* Leads to **huge images** (e.g., Node.js + `npm` + `node_modules` + source code).

With multistage builds:

* Only the **final app binary/code** is included.
* Base images like `alpine` make the final image super small (\~10 MB).


### 📘 Example: Node.js App

```dockerfile
# 🔨 Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .

# 🏃 Stage 2: Runtime
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app .
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

> ✅ This approach keeps only production dependencies and drops all dev tooling — cutting image size by up to **80%**.


### 📘 Example: Go App (Static Binary)

```dockerfile
# 🔨 Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# 🏃 Stage 2: Minimal Image
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
CMD ["./myapp"]
```

> ✅ This results in a **\~10MB** final image instead of 700MB+ if using Go’s full image.


### ✅ Benefits

* 📦 **Smaller image size** → faster builds, pulls, and deployments
* 🛡️ **Improved security** → fewer attack surfaces
* ⚡ **Better performance** in CI/CD and container orchestration (K8s, ECS)
