# 📦 What is Docker Storage?

- Docker **storage drivers** manage how **images and containers** are stored on the host file system.
- Each driver uses a different technique for **layering and managing file changes**. Docker’s pluggable architecture allows it to support multiple storage backends.

---

## ⚙️ What is a Storage Driver?

A **storage driver** is a component that enables Docker to create and manage:

* Image layers
* Container writable layers
* File system operations (copy-on-write, read/write, etc.)

The **storage driver** you choose directly affects performance, compatibility, and capabilities.

---

## 🔧 Common Docker Storage Drivers

### 🔹 `overlay2` (Preferred)

* **Default and recommended** storage driver for all modern Linux distributions.
* Uses a modern kernel feature (`multiple lowerdir`) to efficiently layer images.
* Offers better **performance and scalability** than older drivers.
* No special setup is required.

```bash
# Example: Check current storage driver
docker info | grep 'Storage Driver'
```

---

### 🔹 `overlay` (Deprecated)

* Legacy version of `overlay2`.
* Used on older kernels that **did not support multiple lowerdir**.
* Deprecated as all modern distributions now support `overlay2`.

---

### 🔹 `aufs` (Legacy)

* Was default on Ubuntu 14.04 with kernel 3.13.
* Used before `overlay2` was widely supported.
* Requires installing `aufs` utilities separately in many cases.
* Still supported, but **not recommended** for new systems.

---

## 📌 Best Practice

> ✅ Always use `overlay2` unless you have a specific kernel or OS constraint.

You can specify a storage driver during Docker installation or change it in the Docker daemon config:

```json
# /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

Restart Docker after changing the config:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
