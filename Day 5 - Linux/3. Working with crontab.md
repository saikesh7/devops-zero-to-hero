### **Working with `crontab` Command**

#### **What is `crontab`?**
- `crontab` is a command used to schedule tasks to run at specific intervals or times on a Unix-like operating system.
- It runs background processes at set times or on set dates, such as backups, report generation, etc.

#### **Crontab Syntax**
```
MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD
```
Where:
- **MIN** - Minute field (0 to 59)
- **HOUR** - Hour field (0 to 23)
- **DOM** - Day of the Month (1 to 31)
- **MON** - Month field (1 to 12)
- **DOW** - Day of the Week (0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday)
- **CMD** - Command to be executed (any command or script)

#### **Example: Script to Log Current Date**
Create a script `/opt/script.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example script: Logs current date and message to /var/log/script.log

LOGFILE="/var/log/script.log"

# Create log file if it doesn't exist
touch "$LOGFILE"

# Write date and message
echo "[$(date)] Script executed successfully." >> "$LOGFILE"
```

#### **Set Permissions**
```bash
chmod 777 /opt/script.sh
sudo touch /var/log/script.log
sudo chmod 666 /var/log/script.log
```

#### **Set up Cron Job**
1. Edit the crontab file:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line to run the script every 2 minutes:
   ```
   */2 * * * * /opt/script.sh
   ```

#### **Verify Cron Job Execution**
To check whether the script executed and logged the output, use:

```bash
cat /var/log/script.log
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
[Mon Apr 14 10:40:01 UTC 2025] Script executed successfully.
[Mon Apr 14 10:42:01 UTC 2025] Script executed successfully.
[Mon Apr 14 10:44:01 UTC 2025] Script executed successfully.
[Mon Apr 14 10:46:01 UTC 2025] Script executed successfully.
```

#### **Check Cron Logs**
To verify cron job activity, check the cron logs located in `/var/log/cron`:

```bash
cd /var/log/cron
```
#### **Check Crontab Service Status**
To ensure that the cron service is running, use the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status crond
```

This will show the status of the cron service, and you should see something like:

```bash
● crond.service - Command Scheduler
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/crond.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Mon 2025-04-14 10:30:00 UTC; 10min ago
 Main PID: 1234 (crond)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 4915)
   Memory: 1.2M
   CGroup: /system.slice/crond.service
           └─1234 /usr/sbin/crond -n
```

If the service is not active, you can start or restart it using:

```bash
sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemctl restart crond
```

You can also enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable crond
```
