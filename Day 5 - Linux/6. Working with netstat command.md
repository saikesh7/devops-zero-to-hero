# **Working with `netstat` Command in Linux**  

## üß† What is `netstat`?

`netstat` (short for **network statistics**) is a command-line tool used to:
- Display active **network connections** (TCP/UDP).
- Show **listening ports**.
- View **routing tables**.
- Monitor **network interface statistics**.
- Identify **open ports** and **services/processes** using them.

It is useful for system administrators, developers, and security analysts for diagnosing network issues or checking service availability.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: On some newer Linux systems, `netstat` is deprecated in favor of `ss`, but it's still widely used and supported.

## üìò Commonly Used `netstat` Commands & Examples

| Command                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `netstat -a`                    | Shows **all** active connections and **listening** ports (TCP + UDP). |
| `netstat -at`                   | Shows **only TCP** connections. |
| `netstat -au`                   | Shows **only UDP** connections. |
| `netstat -l`                    | Displays **only listening** sockets. |
| `netstat -lt`                   | Shows **only listening TCP** ports. |
| `netstat -lu`                   | Shows **only listening UDP** ports. |
| `netstat -lx`                   | Displays **listening UNIX domain sockets** (used for inter-process communication). |
| `netstat -s`                    | Shows **summary of network statistics** (for all protocols: TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). |
| `netstat -st`                   | Shows **detailed TCP statistics**. |
| `netstat -su`                   | Shows **detailed UDP statistics**. |
| `netstat -c`                    | Displays network stats **continuously**, updating in real-time. |
| `netstat --verbose`            | Shows **more detailed output** (depends on system support). |
| `netstat -r`                    | Displays the **kernel routing table** (like `route -n`). |
| `netstat -an \| grep 8080`      | Filters connections to check if **port 8080** is in use (common for web apps). |


## **1. Display All Network Connections**  
```sh
netstat -a
```
‚úÖ Shows **all active and listening** network connections.

## **2. Display Only TCP Connections**  
```sh
netstat -at
```
‚úÖ Displays **only TCP** connections.

## **3. Display Only UDP Connections**  
```sh
netstat -au
```
‚úÖ Displays **only UDP** connections.

## **4. Display Listening Ports**  
```sh
netstat -l
```
‚úÖ Shows **only listening** sockets.

### **4.1. Show Only Listening TCP Ports**
```sh
netstat -lt
```
‚úÖ Lists **only listening TCP** ports.

### **4.2. Show Only Listening UDP Ports**
```sh
netstat -lu
```
‚úÖ Lists **only listening UDP** ports.

### **4.3. Show Listening UNIX Domain Sockets**
```sh
netstat -lx
```
‚úÖ Lists **listening UNIX domain sockets**.

## **5. Show Network Statistics**  
```sh
netstat -s
```
‚úÖ Displays **network statistics** (packets received, errors, dropped packets, etc.).

### **5.1. Show Only TCP Statistics**
```sh
netstat -st
```
‚úÖ Displays **only TCP statistics**.

### **5.2. Show Only UDP Statistics**
```sh
netstat -su
```
‚úÖ Displays **only UDP statistics**.

## **6. Continuously Monitor Network Connections**  
```sh
netstat -c
```
‚úÖ Continuously updates **network statistics every second**.

## **7. Display More Verbose Output**  
```sh
netstat --verbose
```
‚úÖ Provides **detailed information** about the network status.

## **8. Show Kernel Routing Table (Similar to `route -n`)**  
```sh
netstat -r
```
‚úÖ Displays the **routing table** (like `route -n`).

## **9. Find Processes Using a Specific Port**  
```sh
netstat -an | grep 8080
```
‚úÖ Checks which process is **using port 8080**.


## **Alternative to `netstat` (`ss` Command in Modern Linux Versions)**  
Since `netstat` is deprecated, use the **`ss` (socket statistics)** command instead:

### **Show All TCP Connections**  
```sh
ss -t
```

### **Show All UDP Connections**  
```sh
ss -u
```

### **Show Listening TCP Ports**  
```sh
ss -lt
```

### **Show Listening UDP Ports**  
```sh
ss -lu
```


### üîÑ TCP Connection States Explained:

| **State**       | **Meaning** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **LISTENING**   | The server (your system) is waiting for incoming connections on a port. Typically seen on services like web servers (`:80`, `:443`, etc.). |
| **ESTABLISHED** | A successful TCP connection is active between two endpoints. This is the state of an open, working connection for data transfer. |
| **CLOSE_WAIT**  | The remote side has closed the connection, but your system hasn‚Äôt yet fully closed it. Usually indicates your app hasn't closed the socket properly. |
| **TIME_WAIT**   | Your system has closed the connection, but is waiting to ensure all packets are properly handled before fully releasing it (prevents delayed packets from causing confusion). |
| **SYN_SENT**    | Your system has sent a request to establish a connection and is waiting for the other side to acknowledge. |
| **SYN_RECEIVED**| A connection request (SYN) was received and an acknowledgment was sent. The server is waiting for the final ACK. |
| **FIN_WAIT_1**  | Your system has started closing the connection and sent a FIN packet, waiting for ACK. |
| **FIN_WAIT_2**  | Waiting for the other side to finish closing. |
| **LAST_ACK**    | Your system is waiting for the final acknowledgment of a connection close. |
| **CLOSED**      | The connection is fully closed and no longer exists. |
