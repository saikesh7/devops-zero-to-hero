### 🧠 What Is a Shared Library in Jenkins?

- A **Shared Library** in Jenkins is a centralized and reusable set of **Groovy scripts** that multiple Jenkins pipelines (Declarative or Scripted) can use.
- It promotes **code reuse**, **consistency**, and **maintainability** across Jenkins jobs.

Instead of duplicating pipeline logic in every Jenkinsfile, you can define common logic once in a shared library and import it wherever needed.


### 📘 Real-World Example

Suppose you have several Jenkins pipelines that build Java applications using **Maven**. Rather than writing the same Maven-related steps in each pipeline, you can place those steps in a shared library. Then, each pipeline can simply call that shared function.

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _
mavenBuild()
```

### 📁 Folder Structure of a Jenkins Shared Library

```
(root)
├── src/                       # Groovy source files (custom classes)
│   └── org/
│       └── foo/
│           └── Bar.groovy    # Class: org.foo.Bar
├── vars/                     # Global variables & functions (entry points)
│   ├── foo.groovy            # Global var/function: foo()
│   └── foo.txt               # Optional: Help text for foo
└── resources/                # Static files used by src/ or vars/
    └── org/
        └── foo/
            └── bar.json      # Example resource file
```

### 📂 Directory Purpose

| Directory    | Purpose                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/`       | Contains reusable Groovy classes. Structured like Java packages. Use `import` to include in `vars/`.             |
| `vars/`      | Contains global functions and variables accessible in Jenkinsfiles. Each `.groovy` file defines one entry point. |
| `resources/` | Contains static files (e.g., JSON, XML, config files) accessible using `libraryResource`.                        |


### ✅ Benefits of Using Shared Libraries

* **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):** Reuse logic across multiple pipelines.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic in Jenkinsfiles, helper logic in the library.
* **Version Control:** Keep your libraries in Git and version them.
* **Testing & Maintenance:** Easier to test and update central logic.
