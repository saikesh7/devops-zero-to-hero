## Understanding and Implementing GitHub Branch Protection Rulesets

A **ruleset** in GitHub is a **collection of rules** that you apply to branches or tags to control **how code changes are made**, **who can make them**, and under **what conditions**.

It‚Äôs a **modern, more flexible version** of the older **branch protection rules**, introduced by GitHub for better security and customization.

---

## üîí **What a Ruleset Does**
It lets you enforce **policies** like:

- Only allowing pull requests to update a branch (no direct pushes).
- Requiring status checks (tests, builds) to pass before merging.
- Blocking force-pushes or branch deletions.
- Requiring signed commits.
- Restricting branch creation, updates, or deletion to specific users or apps.
- Ensuring deployments or code scanning pass before merging.

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Use a Ruleset?**
To:
- **Protect critical branches** (like `main`, `production`, etc.).
- Prevent mistakes like force-pushing or deleting important code.
- Ensure **code quality** through automated checks.
- Control **who can make changes** and **how** they do it.

### üîπ **Branch Rules** (These are the actual protections)

Here's what each rule does:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Restrict creations** | Only users with bypass permissions can create new branches or refs matching this rule. |
| **Restrict updates** | Prevent updates (like commits) to matching branches unless user has bypass permissions. |
| **Restrict deletions** | Prevent deletion of matching branches unless the user has bypass permissions. |
| **Require linear history** | Prevents merge commits. Only allow rebase/squash workflows to keep the history clean. |
| **Require deployments to succeed** | You can set environments (like staging or production). Code can only be merged if deployment to those environments succeeds. |
| **Require signed commits** | Ensures all commits are GPG-signed and verified. Prevents unsigned commits. |
| **Require pull request before merging** | Enforces that **no direct pushes** are allowed. Code must be merged via PR. |
| **Require status checks to pass** | Require checks (e.g., unit tests, linting) to pass before allowing the branch to update. |
| **Block force pushes** | Disables the ability to `git push --force` to the protected branches. |
| **Require code scanning results** | Ensures security/code scanning tools report results before updating the branch. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Ruleset (for `main` branch)
| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Require pull requests | No one can push directly; must open a PR |
| Require status checks | Tests must pass before merging |
| Require signed commits | Only verified commits are allowed |
| Block force pushes | Prevents history rewriting |
| Restrict deletions | Branch cannot be deleted |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Rulesets are only enforced** on **GitHub Team or Enterprise** plans.
- They are more powerful than older **branch protection rules**, allowing multiple rulesets per repo, scoped to different branches/tags/users.
