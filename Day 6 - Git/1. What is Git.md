## **What is Git?**  
- Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used for tracking changes in code, managing source code efficiently, and enabling multiple developers to collaborate on a project.
- It helps maintain a history of changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.

‚úÖ **Key Features of Git:**  
- Tracks changes in files efficiently.  
- Supports multiple developers working simultaneously.  
- Provides a history of all changes made in a project.  
- Supports branching and merging for better workflow management.  
- Works offline‚Äîdevelopers can commit changes without an internet connection.  

## **Advantages of Git**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Open Source & Free**  
Git is completely **free to use** and **open-source**, making it a popular choice for developers worldwide.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Flexibility**  
Git can be used for **small-scale personal projects** as well as **large-scale enterprise applications**. It supports **different workflows**, allowing teams to choose what best suits their needs.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Security**  
Git uses **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)** to **protect** the integrity of the codebase. This prevents malicious code alterations.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Cross-Platform Support**  
Git runs on **Linux, Windows, and macOS**, making it highly accessible for all developers.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Branching & Merging**  
Git supports **lightweight branching**, allowing developers to work on multiple features **independently**. Once a feature is completed, it can be **merged** back into the main project.  

## **Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)**  

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that tracks changes to code, documents, or files. There are three main types:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Local Version Control System (LVCS)**  
- Stores versions on a local machine.  
- Example: RCS (Revision Control System).  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**  
- A **single central server** manages all versions.  
- Developers work with a **central repository** over the network.  
- **Disadvantage:** If the server crashes, all data may be lost.  
- **Example:** **SVN (Subversion), TFS (Team Foundation Server)**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**  
- Each developer has a **complete copy** of the repository.  
- Code is **not dependent on a central server**.  
- Offers **faster performance** and **better collaboration**.  
- **Example:** **Git, Mercurial**.  

üìå **Comparison:**  

| Feature  | Git (DVCS) | SVN (CVCS) | TFS (CVCS) |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Speed** | Fast | Slower | Slower |
| **Branching** | Easy & cheap | Difficult | Difficult |
| **Offline Work** | Yes | No | No |
| **Centralized Server Required?** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Security** | High (SHA-1 encryption) | Medium | Medium |
| **Used By** | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket | Some legacy projects | Microsoft Teams |

## **Why Git Over SVN & TFS?**  
‚úÖ Git is **faster**, **more secure**, and **supports distributed development**.  
‚úÖ Git allows **offline work**, whereas SVN & TFS require a network connection.  
‚úÖ Git‚Äôs **branching and merging** capabilities are more advanced than SVN & TFS.
